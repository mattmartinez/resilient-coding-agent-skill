# Resilient Coding Agent

Long-running coding tasks are vulnerable to interruption: orchestrator restarts, process crashes, network drops. This skill decouples Claude Code from the orchestrator using tmux, enabling fire-and-forget execution with automatic resume on interruption. The orchestrator specifies which model to use; the skill handles session lifecycle, crash recovery, and output capture.

## Placeholders

- **`<task-name>`** -- Sanitized task identifier. Must match `[a-z0-9-]` only.
- **`<project-dir>`** -- Valid existing directory where the task executes.
- **`<model>`** -- Model tier passed by the Brain. Maps to a full model name in the launch command:

| Brain sends | CLI receives |
|-------------|-------------|
| `opus` | `claude-opus-4-6` |
| `sonnet` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |

Full model names are used for determinism. Aliases auto-resolve to the latest version, which could change behavior unexpectedly.

## Temp Directory and Prompt Safety

Each task uses a secure temp directory created with `mktemp -d`. Store this path and use it for all task files (prompt, events, session state). This avoids predictable filenames and symlink/race conditions.

```bash
TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d)
chmod 700 "$TMPDIR"
```

**Prompt safety:** Task prompts are never interpolated into shell commands. Instead, write the prompt to a temp file using the orchestrator's `write` tool (no shell involved), then reference it with `"$(cat $TASK_TMPDIR/prompt)"` inside the tmux command. The shell treats command substitution output inside double quotes as a single literal argument, preventing injection. This depends on the orchestrator's `write` tool not invoking a shell; OpenClaw's built-in `write` tool meets this requirement.

**Sensitive output:** tmux scrollback and log files may contain secrets or API keys from agent output. On shared machines, restrict file permissions (`chmod 600`) and clean up temp directories after task completion.

## When to Use This

Use this skill for ALL tasks that are not pure conversational chat. This includes:
- Coding, debugging, refactoring, and architecture work
- File exploration, search, and analysis
- Test writing and test debugging
- Documentation generation
- Code review and security analysis
- Any reasoning or investigation task

You are NOT a coding agent. Do not attempt to do coding work directly.
Delegate ALL substantive work through this skill, regardless of expected duration.

## Task Directory Schema

Every task operates within a secure temp directory. The following layout is the canonical specification -- all phases build on this convention.

```
$TMPDIR/                         # mktemp -d, chmod 700
  prompt                         # Task instructions
                                 #   Written by: orchestrator write tool
                                 #   Read by: Claude Code via $(cat)
                                 #   Created: Phase 1 (existing)

  pid                            # Claude Code child process PID
                                 #   Written by: task wrapper (pgrep)
                                 #   Read by: monitor.sh (kill -0)
                                 #   Created: Phase 2

  output.log                     # Continuous output capture
                                 #   Written by: tmux pipe-pane
                                 #   Read by: Brain (tail -n 50), monitor (mtime)
                                 #   Created: Phase 2

  manifest.json                  # Structured task state (JSON)
                                 #   Written by: task wrapper + monitor
                                 #   Read by: Brain
                                 #   Created: Phase 3

  done                           # Completion marker (presence = complete)
                                 #   Written by: task wrapper on exit
                                 #   Read by: monitor.sh ([ -f done ])
                                 #   Created: Phase 2

  exit_code                      # Process exit code (numeric string)
                                 #   Written by: task wrapper (echo $?)
                                 #   Read by: monitor.sh, manifest updater
                                 #   Created: Phase 2
```

**Status:** Phase 1 created `prompt`. Phase 2 implements `pid`, `output.log`, `done`, and `exit_code` via the shell wrapper and pipe-pane patterns above. The remaining file (`manifest.json`) is created in Phase 3. Each file lists its phase of introduction -- do not create files before their designated phase.

## Start a Task

Create a tmux session and launch Claude Code with the appropriate model. The launch sequence uses a shell wrapper that captures the Claude Code PID, waits for completion, and writes structured completion markers.

```bash
# Step 1: Create secure temp directory
TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d) && chmod 700 "$TMPDIR"

# Step 2: Write prompt to file (use orchestrator's write tool, not echo/shell)
# File: $TMPDIR/prompt

# Step 3: Create tmux session (pass TMPDIR via env)
tmux new-session -d -s claude-<task-name> -e "TASK_TMPDIR=$TMPDIR"

# Step 4: Start output capture with ANSI stripping (BEFORE send-keys)
tmux pipe-pane -t claude-<task-name> -O \
  "perl -pe 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*[mGKHfABCDJsu]//g; s/\x1b\][^\x07]*\x07//g; s/\x1b\(B//g; s/\r//g' >> $TMPDIR/output.log"

# Step 5: Launch with wrapper (PID capture + done-file protocol)
tmux send-keys -t claude-<task-name> \
  'cd <project-dir> && claude -p --model <model-name> "$(cat $TASK_TMPDIR/prompt)" & CLAUDE_PID=$!; echo "$CLAUDE_PID" > "$TASK_TMPDIR/pid"; wait $CLAUDE_PID; echo $? > "$TASK_TMPDIR/exit_code.tmp" && mv "$TASK_TMPDIR/exit_code.tmp" "$TASK_TMPDIR/exit_code" && touch "$TASK_TMPDIR/done"' Enter
```

**Step 4 -- pipe-pane** is set BEFORE send-keys to guarantee no output is missed. The `-O` flag captures only pane output (not input). The perl chain strips four categories of ANSI escapes: CSI sequences (colors, cursor movement), OSC sequences (window titles), charset selection, and carriage returns (progress bar overwrites).

**Step 5 -- wrapper** runs these steps in sequence: (1) launch Claude Code in background with `&`, (2) capture PID via `$!`, (3) write PID to file immediately, (4) `wait` blocks until Claude exits and preserves exit code, (5) atomic exit_code write (write-to-tmp then `mv`), (6) `touch done` as the completion signal. The exit_code is written BEFORE done to prevent a race condition where the monitor sees done but exit_code does not yet exist.

Replace `<model-name>` with the full model name from the mapping table:
- Brain sends `opus` --> use `claude-opus-4-6`
- Brain sends `sonnet` --> use `claude-sonnet-4-6`

Both `-p` and `--model` flags are required. `-p` enables non-interactive (print) mode for fire-and-forget execution. `--model` selects the model tier. Without `-p`, Claude Code enters interactive mode inside tmux, which defeats fire-and-forget execution.

### Completion Notification

Chain an OpenClaw system event after the agent so the Brain is notified on completion. The notification is placed BEFORE `touch done` so the done-file remains the last thing written regardless of notification success:

```bash
tmux send-keys -t claude-<task-name> \
  'cd <project-dir> && claude -p --model <model-name> "$(cat $TASK_TMPDIR/prompt)" & CLAUDE_PID=$!; echo "$CLAUDE_PID" > "$TASK_TMPDIR/pid"; wait $CLAUDE_PID; ECODE=$?; echo "$ECODE" > "$TASK_TMPDIR/exit_code.tmp" && mv "$TASK_TMPDIR/exit_code.tmp" "$TASK_TMPDIR/exit_code"; openclaw system event --text "Claude done: <task-name>" --mode now; touch "$TASK_TMPDIR/done"' Enter
```

The `openclaw system event` uses `;` (fire-and-forget) so notification failure does not block completion. It runs after exit_code is written but before done is touched.

## Monitor Progress

Continuous output is captured to `$TMPDIR/output.log` via pipe-pane (set up in Step 4 of the launch sequence). This is the preferred way to read task output:

```bash
# Read recent output from continuous log (preferred)
tail -n 50 $TMPDIR/output.log
```

For ad-hoc checks or manual debugging, tmux capture-pane is still available:

```bash
# Check if the session is still running
tmux has-session -t claude-<task-name> 2>/dev/null && echo "running" || echo "finished/gone"

# Read recent output (last 200 lines) via tmux
tmux capture-pane -t claude-<task-name> -p -S -200

# Read the full scrollback via tmux
tmux capture-pane -t claude-<task-name> -p -S -
```

Check progress when:
- The user asks for a status update
- You want to proactively report milestones

## Health Monitoring

For long-running tasks, use the active monitor script (`scripts/monitor.sh`) instead of checking on demand.

The monitor runs a periodic check loop using a three-priority detection flow:

1. **Done-file check** -- If `$TASK_TMPDIR/done` exists, the task completed. Read `$TASK_TMPDIR/exit_code` for the result. Exit monitor.
2. **PID liveness check** -- Read PID from `$TASK_TMPDIR/pid` and test with `kill -0 $PID`. If the process is dead and no done-file exists, the task crashed. Resume via `claude -c` in the same tmux session.
3. **Session existence** -- If the tmux session is gone (`tmux has-session` fails), the task is lost. Exit monitor.

The done-file is checked FIRST because a completed task may have a dead PID (expected). Only if done-file is absent does a dead PID indicate a crash.

The orchestrator should run this check loop periodically (every 3-5 minutes, via cron or a background timer). On consecutive failures, the monitor doubles the interval (3m, 6m, 12m, ...) and resets when the agent is running normally. The monitor stops after 5 hours wall-clock.

## Recovery After Interruption

For automated crash detection and retries, use **Health Monitoring** above. Keep this section as a manual fallback when you need to intervene directly:

```bash
# Resume the most recent Claude Code session in the working directory
tmux send-keys -t claude-<task-name> 'claude -c' Enter
```

`claude -c` continues the most recent conversation in the current working directory. This is the correct resume command for Claude Code sessions running inside tmux, where only one conversation exists per session.

## Cleanup

After a task completes, disable pipe-pane before killing the session. This prevents orphan perl processes that would otherwise hold stale file descriptors:

```bash
tmux pipe-pane -t claude-<task-name>  # Disable pipe-pane (no command = disable)
tmux kill-session -t claude-<task-name>
```

List all coding agent tmux sessions:

```bash
tmux list-sessions 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^claude-'
```

## Naming Convention

Tmux sessions use the pattern `claude-<task-name>`:

- `claude-refactor-auth`
- `claude-review-pr-42`
- `claude-fix-api-tests`

Keep names short, lowercase, hyphen-separated. The `claude-` prefix identifies sessions managed by this skill.

## Checklist

Before starting a task:

1. Create secure temp directory (`mktemp -d` + `chmod 700`)
2. Write prompt to `$TMPDIR/prompt` via orchestrator write tool
3. Create tmux session with `TASK_TMPDIR` env var
4. Set up pipe-pane output capture with ANSI stripping
5. Launch Claude Code with wrapper (PID capture + done-file protocol)
6. Verify pipe-pane is capturing output (`ls -la $TMPDIR/output.log`)
7. Notify user: task content, session name (`claude-<task-name>`), model used
8. Monitor via `scripts/monitor.sh` (done-file/PID detection) or `tail -n 50 $TMPDIR/output.log`

## Limitations

- tmux sessions do not survive a **machine reboot** (tmux itself is killed). For reboot recovery, `claude -c` in the project directory will resume the most recent conversation.
- Interactive approval prompts inside tmux require manual `tmux attach` or `tmux send-keys`. Use `-p` flag for non-interactive mode.

## Prerequisites

This skill requires:
- **tmux** -- Process isolation and session management
- **Claude Code CLI** (`claude`) -- The coding agent that executes tasks

The orchestrator must be configured to delegate coding tasks through this skill instead of attempting them directly. SKILL.md is the orchestrator's interface -- it reads this document and follows the instructions.
